Downloaded and transferred files that I'll need for the project. Started filling out the html structure of the page. Added some css elements.

Need to figure out some things... like how to make the form items align properly. Make the right side content boxes stretch out accordingly. Place the footer at the bottom of left background image (centered)...

Might need to rethink the logo... 'cause I need to include a text...

Significant progress... finally was able to align the form field-elements properly using flexbox..!! Looks much better now. I put the footer text inside the image (at the bottom) and added a text besides the logo.

I might need to adjust some css values so that the page slides accordingly to the desktop (or mobile) window size...

Styled the button and some other small things as well.
