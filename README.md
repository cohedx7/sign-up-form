Downloaded and transferred files that I'll need for the project. Started filling out the html structure of the page. Added some css elements.

Need to figure out some things... like how to make the form items align properly. Make the right side content boxes stretch out accordingly. Place the footer at the bottom of left background image (centered)...

Might need to rethink the logo... 'cause I need to include a text...
