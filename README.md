Created first initial files, setup basic html structure. Downloaded sample images to use in form page, will need to transfer them here eventually...

Downloaded and transferred files that I'll need for the project. Started filling out the html structure of the page. Added some css elements.

Need to figure out some things... like how to make the form items align properly. Make the right side content boxes stretch out accordingly. Place the footer at the bottom of left background image (centered)...

Might need to rethink the logo... 'cause I need to include a text...

Made some minor modifications, but not much progress...

Significant progress... finally was able to align the form field-elements properly using flexbox..!! Looks much better now. I put the footer text inside the image (at the bottom) and added a text besides the logo.

I might need to adjust some css values so that the page slides accordingly to the desktop (or mobile) window size...

Styled the button and some other small things as well.

Changed some view settings so the boxes and window resize accordingly. Also repositioned the footer and logo texts (along with the images).

It seems ok for the most part. Added button change color on hover and input fields' boxes change to red color on focus.

I guess it's pretty much done at this point. I might need to refine some things-elements, but yea I'm pretty satisfied with how this turned out.
